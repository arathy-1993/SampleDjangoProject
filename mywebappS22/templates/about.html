        <h3 class="para-head">History</h3>
        <p>
            <h4 id="para-content">In 1935, Windsor, Sandwich, East Windsor and Walkerville united to form the
            City of Windsor. This amalgamation was intended to address the crushing debt and social demands brought
            by the Great Depression. In the 1960s, the City of Windsor looked to surrounding communities to expand
            its land and tax base. The city attempted to annex the towns of Tecumseh, Riverside, Ojibway, all or part
            of St. Clair Beach and parts of the townships of Sandwich East, Sandwich West, and Sandwich South.
            It was a topic of heated debate. In the end, it was decided that Riverside, Ojibway and parts of
            Sandwich townships would become part of Windsor. Windsor continues to grow. Another annexation of land,
            from the Town of  Tecumseh, occurred in 2003 to create the current border of the City of Windsor.</h4>

        <h3 class="para-head">Location</h3>
        <p>
            <h4 id="para-content">Windsor is a large city located in the province of Ontario which can be found
            in South Canada. It is well known as the southernmost city of Canada. Windsor is located on the
            southern banks of the river of Detroit, opposite the city of Detroit in Michigan, right between
            the lakes of Erie and Saint Clair.</h4>
        </p>

        <h3 class="para-head">Climate</h3>
        <p>
            <h4 id="para-content">Located in the far south of Ontario, close to the American city
            of Detroit, Windsor enjoys the warmest climate of any of Ontarioâ€™s cities.
            Windsor has a semi-continental climate, with a warm, humid summer and a cold winter.</h4>
        </p>

        <h3 class="para-head">Culture</h3>
        <p>
            <h4 id="para-content">Even if you spend a day in Windsor you'll notice that it's a very
            multi-cultural city, especially for its small town feel. Right off the bat, visitors will hear
            English, French, Arabic and Italian. Near the east side of the downtown area is the North African/Middle
            Eastern neighbourhoods with a large Lebanese community. Southeast of the downtown area is the
            Via Italia neighbourhood, with numerous Italian restaurants and shops. West of the downtown
